* Math (get correct symbols)
1. BoW :: ∀x; x ∈ A
   Each d is a vector of Wf.

* Definitions
1. P1
   The probability of having tf occurrences of the term in the document by pure chance.
      As this decreases, the information content of the document (vis-a-vis/in relation with) the term increases.
2. P2
   (1 - P2) is related to the risk of choosing the query term as a discriminative term and works as a normalization factor.

   Can be used as the probability of having one more occurrence of the term in the document, which leads to penalizting the high frequency terms during retrieval.
3. BoWa :: Each word is sampled independantly from the rest of the words in the document.
4. BoW / VSM :: A simplifying representation. Each d is a vector of Wf.

* Notes
1. Ignore structure but perform well:
   1. LM + BoW = Unigram Model
   2. iTh + BoW = TF-IDF
2. BoWa != BoWM

* Annotations
1. MFR
2. TF-IDF :: Still Competative
3. DRT using BoW
   1. LM :: Uses a PF
   2. DFR :: iTh
4. BoW :: Given a set of documents, allows you to rank them
5. RMF :: Benefit over Traditional BL is IaR

* Uses
1. Bug report is used as a query

* Problem => Solution
1. MRF => IR defect, Loss of inter-term relationships in documents

* IN
1. Concept Localisation
2. Bug Localisation
3. Change Impact Analysis
4. Traceability
5. Link Recovery

* Outline
1. Traditional BL Methods
   1. SCA :: Static Code Analysis
      Need a call graph.
      Can't deal with non-executable files.
   2. Dynamic :: Test cases / Debugger
      Can't make an exhaustive set.
      Also, can't deal with non-executable files.
